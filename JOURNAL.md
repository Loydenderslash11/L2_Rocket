## Week 2 (03/21/2025)

- Designed fin geometry in **RockSim**
- Exported fin profiles to **Fusion 360** for CAD modeling
- Chose airframe material: **carbon fiber cloth over PVC pipe**
- Planned electronics bay and bulkhead layout
- Reviewed flight simulation data for stability and mass predictions

## Week 3 (03/28/2025)

- Finalized 3D models of **fins** and **nose cone** in Fusion 360
- 3D printed test versions of both parts using **PETG**
- Verified dimensional accuracy and fit with airframe
- Integrated updated fin geometry into RockSim model
- Completed airframe segment designs with modular approach in Fusion
