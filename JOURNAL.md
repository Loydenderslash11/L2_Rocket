## Day 1 (03/14/2025)

Spent the whole day researching what body styles are used in high-speed 1/10 scale RC cars. My main goal was to design and 3D model a sleek and aerodynamic body that looked fast and aggressive. I looked at a bunch of real RC speed builds, as well as full-scale supercars, and started sketching side profiles that combined elements from both.

Eventually, I chose a low-slung, wide-body style with a slight cab-forward design. Since I plan to install components later, I kept in mind space for the motor, ESC, battery, and wiring while shaping the shell. For now, I’m focusing on just the body design and fit.

I also looked at how actual RC shells are mounted. Most use clips or Velcro tabs, so I added placeholder slots into my draft in case I want to make it mountable later. No BOM or electronics just yet—this is the first step of a two-phase project.

## Day 2 (03/25/2025)

Started the actual modeling process in Fusion 360. I used a reference blueprint for a 1/10 touring car to get accurate proportions. Then I began blocking out a body shell with four flared fenders, aggressive side skirts, and a slightly scooped hood.

The roofline was tricky, I didn’t want it to look too boxy or too rounded. I ended up with a teardrop shape that slopes toward the back, sort of like a GT racer. I also added a short ducktail spoiler for visual balance.

Since I plan to add electronics later, I left extra space in key areas: under the hood (for motor/ESC), behind the cab (for the battery), and added draft lines for wire routing. These are only visual guides for now, but they’ll help when I start cutting or modifying the body for real hardware.

## Day 3 (04/10/2025)

Refined the main shape of the body shell. Smoothed out all sharp transitions using fillets and made sure the thickness of the body was uniform all around (2mm). This would make it easier to print and also more realistic.

I spent a lot of time designing the front end. Added a fake grille and intake vents, not functional of course, but they make the design look way more serious. Also experimented with headlight pockets just for detail they’re empty but look cool.

For the rear, I designed a wide diffuser and exhaust cutouts. The back end now looks planted and aggressive. I also mocked up side mirrors and molded-in window outlines.

Printed a scaled-down version just to see how it looked in physical form. Even though it was a mini, the stance came through really well. Once I finalize the electronics later, I’ll return to modify these prints for airflow and fit.

## Day 4 (05/03/2025)

Worked on details and made sure there was enough clearance for all the electronics I plan to install. Added a sunroof cutout, rear glass vent lines, and sharp crease lines on the door panels to break up the surface.

Also designed a functional-looking hood scoop and indented vents over the front fenders. These don’t work (yet), but if I want to add real airflow paths later, the design can be adapted.

I will be 3d printing  the front half of the body full size in PETG to test panel fit and curvature. (when the components arrive) Print settings:

* Nozzle Temp: 230°C
* Bed Temp: 80°C
* Infill: 20% Grid
* Layer Height: 0.2 mm
* Slicer: Cura

No major warping or fit issues. A few tweaks might be needed when I start placing real motors and wiring.

## Day 5 (06/30/2025)

Finalized the RC body shell model today. Added support ribs on the inside to stiffen the shell once electronics are installed. Smoothed out every seam and transition, double-checked dimensions, and aligned everything to a central axis.

Made a rear wing that mounts directly onto the tail section using two simple posts. Also added cut lines to the STL so it can be printed in smaller sections for printers with a smaller build volume.

Exported everything and uploaded it to GitHub along with renders, print settings, and screenshots from Fusion 360. Super proud of how clean and sharp the body looks—totally looks like it could rip at 50+ mph once it’s fully assembled.

Now that the body is done, the next phase will be sourcing the electronics and chassis components. I already have plans for a 3650 brushless motor, ESC, and high-discharge LiPo setup. All dimensions and clearance zones in the model were made with this in mind. Can’t wait to see the whole thing come together for real.
