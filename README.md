# Project MightyMouse ‚Äì Level 2 High-Power Rocket

Welcome to the repository for **Project MightyMouse**, my custom-designed **Level 2 high-power rocket** built for TRA/NAR certification. This rocket was developed using 3D CAD modeling, PETG printing, carbon fiber reinforcement, and professional avionics. It's powered by a Cesaroni J520 Skidmark and is capable of reaching altitudes around 5,000 feet.
